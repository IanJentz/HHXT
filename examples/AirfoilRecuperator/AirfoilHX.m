%% Geometry
% Define the geometry of the HX using the |Geom_AirfoilHX()| function.
% This will result in a geometry with 12 Faces/Regions and 128 edges
%
% The airfoil recuperator has streams that enter at the sides of the
% recuperator body.  The hot and cold channels gradually trun in from the
% sides, meeting at a counterflow configuration.
%
% This is accomplished using the following features:
% - core region: face 4, this is the main counterflow airfoil microchannel core
% - transition region: faces 10 and 12, here the hot and cold channels
% begin to diverge, turning their flow outwards
% - entrace/exit regions: faces 6, 7, 9, and 11, contain only hot or cold
% channels that continue turning toward the side boudaries. faces 1, 2, 5,
% and 8, are no longer turning and contain channels oriented in the y
% direction.
% - solid wall: face 3, completely solid material that forms the side wall
% and header walls
%
% note Geom_AirfoilHX() also returns the variable turnCorners, which is the
% centers about which the airfoil channels make their turns.  This variable
% is made global so that it can be used within the Gamma permeability
% transform functions

global turnCorners
[G,turnCorners] = Geom_AirfoilHX(model,'Block',L,W,0,wall,offsets,header_thk,stickout);
