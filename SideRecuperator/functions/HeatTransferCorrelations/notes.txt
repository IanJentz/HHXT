%% Heat Transfer Coefficient Functions
% The microchannel heat transfer coefficient can be dependent on position,
% time, Reynolds number, and Prandtl number.
% Functional deifinitions must accept the following inputs (pos,time,Re,Pr)
% Where pos is a structure containing arrays of coordinates pos [x;y]
% And where time, Re, and Pr are arrays of time in sec,
% Reynolds number, and Prandtl number.
% Note the here the Re is the Reynolds magnitude, i.e. magnitude of the
% vector of directional Reynolds numbers [Re_x,Re_y].
