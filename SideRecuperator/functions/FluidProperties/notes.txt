%% RealGas Fluid Properties: Varying Pressure and Temperature
% Properties of the fluids, streams 1 & 2, can be dependent on position,
% time, temperature, and pressure.  
% Functional definitions must accept the inputs (pos,time,temp,press)
% Where pos is a structure containing arrays of coordinates pos [x;y].
% And where time, temp, and press are arrays of time in sec,
% temperature in C, and pressure in Pa.
